## Design Patterns in Python

This is a simple project to test and improve design patterns implementation using Python. 

The initial implementations are based on the book by _Chetan Giridhar_ called [Learning Python Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Design-Patterns-Second-ebook/dp/B018XYKNOM). It is a very simple and objetive book, which lacks a lot of information but was quite usefull to consult.

The main reference for Design Patterns is the book _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_ by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides.

### Why Python?
Python is very fun to learn, very quick to get stuff out of it and very usefull for smaller tasks such as calculating things and glueing together other usefull packages. It became just too popular to avoid but it is far from being a language designed to tackle software complexity.
